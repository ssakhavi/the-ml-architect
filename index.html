Welcome to "The ML Architect" blog. This blog is authored by [Siavash Sakhavi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siavashsakhavi/).
The blog has been created to focus on the following areas:

* Machine Learning & Deep Learning Development & Ideas
* Design Patterns and Software Architectures that have been used in ML 
* DevOps for ML (MLOps)
* Interesting ML and Python tools

You can refer to my [first post]({% post_url 2017-09-04-link-test %}) to see what I mean about "ML Architect". 

Although I could have started the blog somewhere else, I decided to start it here on GitHub pages to give it a try. I hope you'll enjoy. 


This site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), An easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.
[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) automates the process of creating blog posts via GitHub Actions, so you don't have to fuss with conversion scripts.  A full list of features can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages).  
I would like to thank Jeremy Howard and Hamel Husain who pioineered the project and all of the people that have contrbuted to it. You've made our lives easier.
